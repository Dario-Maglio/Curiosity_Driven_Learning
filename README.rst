Curiosity Driven Learning
=========================


The **Curiosity Driven Learning** approach is based on the exploitation of natural brain functionalities - as the ones responsible for pleasure and addiction - to make it easier for anyone to learn; i.e. to make anyone able to develop some basic skills in a curiosity-driven and continuously adapting environment.

The name of the approach intentionally refers to the implementation of **Machine Learning** algorithms to build and modify this kind of environment. Initially, the user is demanded to select a topic which attracts his attention, such as a section on the "On this day" webpage. Then, the algorithm suggests some readings, as Wikipedia pages, and makes the user flow to some "mandatory concepts" in elementary, middle and high school, based on the user feedback.

The basic ingredients of this approach are:
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- Open Knowledge 
  
  The resources to learn and exercise must be free and always available to anyone for educational purposes. "Superflow" of information is the basis for enhancing its elaboration. Social recognition has to be more rewardful than economical one. Wikipedia and Open Source may save the world.
  
- Interdisciplinarity
  
  All of the fields of Scientific or Humanistic knowledge are strongly connected, and switching between different subjects' points of view about the same content may enhance its comprehension. Keeping Art, History, Philosophy and Science as a whole, gives a context with multiple perspectives and practical applications, instead of talking about abstract and mandatory notions. It makes Science more human and Art more meaningful. 

- Collectivity
  
  When we explain something to other Human beings, we receive questions, we ask a question to them... when we interact in general, a different kind of learning and comprehension mechanism takes place. To enhance progress in the fields of knowledge, we must enhance spontaneous and cooperative human interactions. There will always be some kind of competitive mechanism between people, but they can be managed in a cooperative framework as useful tools for improving ourselves instead of struggling with each other.


With the last point, we underline that **AI cannot substitute the role of human relations**, but it is a powerful interactive tool to make them more productive. In a world where scientific and humanistic disseminators are the new influencers, less space for polarization and conflicts remains.
